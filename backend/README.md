# Deckly generation service

FastAPI service that turns a topic into reviewable notes. The contract, architecture and testing
rules live in [`../.claude/backend/`](../.claude/backend/) — read `handoff.md` first.

## Layout

```
src/deckly/
  main.py            composition root: builds the FastAPI app, wires adapters, registers handlers
  config.py          settings from the environment (pydantic-settings), fail-fast on anything missing
  transport/         HTTP: routers, Problem (RFC 9457) model, the single error mapper
  application/       use cases and the ports they depend on; application errors
  domain/            pure business rules; domain errors
  infrastructure/    adapters: async SQLAlchemy + asyncpg, Arq/Redis, JSON logging
  worker/            Arq worker entrypoint, WorkerSettings and its composition root
migrations/          Alembic (async)
```

Dependencies point inward only. `make check` runs import-linter, which fails the build if
`domain` or `application` import an outer layer or an I/O/SDK package (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy,
Redis, Arq…), or if `transport` reaches infrastructure directly. Ruff's `TID251` (banned-api,
scoped to `src/deckly/domain/` in `pyproject.toml`) also fails it if domain code reads the clock
(`datetime.now()`, `utcnow()`, `today()`) or generates ids (`uuid4()`, `uuid1()`) instead of
receiving them as arguments.

## Errors

Domain and application code raise typed errors (`domain/exceptions.py`,
`application/exceptions.py`). `transport/error_handlers.py` is the only place that turns them
into `application/problem+json`, using the `code` table from `api-contract.md`. Request
validation failures become `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`; anything unmapped is logged with its
traceback and returned as `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` with no internal detail.

## Running locally

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker. Run everything from `backend/`.

```bash
make install        # uv sync --locked (installs Python 3.12 if needed)
cp .env.example .env
make up             # Postgres on :5433, Redis on :6380
make migrate        # alembic upgrade head
make run            # uvicorn on :8000 with reload
```

Every setting is required; the app refuses to start if one is missing, blank or invalid, and
if Postgres or Redis are unreachable. The database URL must use `postgresql+asyncpg`.

The worker (`make worker`) consumes the queue that `POST /v1/generations` fills and runs
`application/pipeline.py` (`RunGeneration`): planning → retrieving sources → parsing →
generating cards → fetching media (only when `includeImages` is set) → finalizing. Every stage
change goes through `JobStore.update`, which row-locks the job, so a cancel that lands first
makes the worker stop at its next stage instead of racing it. It runs separately from the API
and shares nothing with it but Postgres and Redis.

Until the real provider adapters exist, the worker is wired with the placeholders in
`infrastructure/providers.py`, which raise `NotImplementedError`: every job it picks up ends
`failed` with `GENERATION_FAILED` rather than staying `queued`. Replace them one by one in
`worker/settings.py` (`startup`).

## Checks

```bash
make check          # ruff format --check, ruff check, mypy --strict, import-linter
make fix            # ruff format + ruff check --fix
make test           # pytest, no infrastructure needed
make test-integration  # Postgres + Redis tests; needs make up && make migrate
```

CI runs `make install`, `make check`, `make test`, then `make migrate` and `make test-integration`
against Postgres and Redis service containers (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `backend` job).
