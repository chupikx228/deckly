# Deckly generation service

FastAPI service that turns a topic into reviewable notes. The contract, architecture and testing
rules live in [`../.claude/backend/`](../.claude/backend/) — read `handoff.md` first.

## Layout

```
src/deckly/
  main.py            composition root: builds the FastAPI app, wires adapters, registers handlers
  config.py          settings from the environment (pydantic-settings), fail-fast on anything missing
  transport/         HTTP: routers, Problem (RFC 9457) model, the single error mapper
  application/       use cases and the ports they depend on; application errors
  domain/            pure business rules; domain errors
  infrastructure/    adapters: async SQLAlchemy + asyncpg, Arq/Redis, JSON logging, the LLM card
                     generator (Anthropic or DeepSeek) and the retry/circuit-breaker layer
  worker/            Arq worker entrypoint, WorkerSettings and its composition root
migrations/          Alembic (async)
```

Dependencies point inward only. `make check` runs import-linter, which fails the build if
`domain` or `application` import an outer layer or an I/O/SDK package (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy,
Redis, Arq…), or if `transport` reaches infrastructure directly. Ruff's `TID251` (banned-api,
scoped to `src/deckly/domain/` in `pyproject.toml`) also fails it if domain code reads the clock
(`datetime.now()`, `utcnow()`, `today()`) or generates ids (`uuid4()`, `uuid1()`) instead of
receiving them as arguments.

## Errors

Domain and application code raise typed errors (`domain/exceptions.py`,
`application/exceptions.py`). `transport/error_handlers.py` is the only place that turns them
into `application/problem+json`, using the `code` table from `api-contract.md`. Request
validation failures become `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`; anything unmapped is logged with its
traceback and returned as `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` with no internal detail.

## Running locally

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker. Run everything from `backend/`.

```bash
make install        # uv sync --locked (installs Python 3.12 if needed)
cp .env.example .env
make up             # Postgres on :5433, Redis on :6380
make migrate        # alembic upgrade head
make run            # uvicorn on :8000 with reload
```

Every setting is required; the app refuses to start if one is missing, blank or invalid, and
if Postgres or Redis are unreachable. The database URL must use `postgresql+asyncpg`.

The worker (`make worker`) consumes the queue that `POST /v1/generations` fills and runs
`application/pipeline.py` (`RunGeneration`): planning → retrieving sources → parsing →
generating cards → fetching media (only when `includeImages` is set) → finalizing. Every stage
change goes through `JobStore.update`, which row-locks the job, so a cancel that lands first
makes the worker stop at its next stage instead of racing it. It runs separately from the API
and shares nothing with it but Postgres and Redis.

Arq's Redis pool has no read timeout of its own, so the API builds its pool itself
(`infrastructure/queue.py`, `create_queue_pool`) with the same connection settings Arq would use
plus a read timeout, and gives every command it sends through the queue that long to finish,
both from `DECKLY_REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. The startup check pings Redis through that same
pool and retries `DECKLY_REDIS_CONNECT_RETRIES` times, one second apart, as Arq does, so a Redis
that accepts connections but never answers makes the API fail to start instead of hanging it.
The read timeout also matters for the enqueue, which runs a `WATCH` transaction: if Redis
answers the `WATCH` and then freezes, redis-py's cleanup reconnects to send `UNWATCH`, and
without a read timeout that wait would never end. An enqueue that gets no answer in time fails
`POST /v1/generations` with `500`, as an unreachable Redis does, instead of hanging it. The job
is already stored by then, so replaying the request with the same `Idempotency-Key` enqueues it
again. When that cleanup gives up, redis-py only lets go of the connection once it is
garbage-collected, which asyncio logs as `Unclosed client session`.

A cancel also stops the work already in flight. Once the job is stored as cancelled,
`POST /v1/generations/{jobId}/cancel` leaves an Arq abort marker for it, and the worker
(`allow_abort_jobs`) cancels the job's task at its next poll, within about half a second. The
cancellation reaches the model call itself and closes its HTTP request, so the provider is not
left producing a reply nobody will read; the resilience layer neither retries it nor counts it
against the provider, and the job stays `cancelled`. The marker is only written after the
cancel is committed: the other way round, the worker would record the interrupted job as
`failed` and the cancel would then get a `409`. Sending it is best effort. If Redis cannot be
reached or does not answer in time, `job_abort_not_signalled` is logged, the cancel still
answers `204`, and the worker stops at its next stage as before. Arq removes a marker when it
cancels or finishes the job; a marker written for a job that ended at that same moment stays in
`arq:abort`, which is harmless because the stored job is already terminal.

The card generator is real (see below). The source retriever, source parser and media fetcher
are still the placeholders in `infrastructure/providers.py`, which raise
`NotImplementedError`. The retriever runs first, so until it exists every job the worker picks
up ends `failed` with `GENERATION_FAILED` at `retrieving_sources` rather than staying `queued`.
Replace them one by one in `worker/settings.py` (`startup`).

## Card generation

`infrastructure/card_generator/` implements the `CardGenerator` port with one model call per
job. `DECKLY_PROVIDER_MODEL_PROVIDER` picks the client: `anthropic` (official SDK) or `deepseek`
(raw `httpx2` against its OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions`, JSON output mode). The model
never gets to invent a source: the prompt numbers each `SourceMaterial`, notes cite those
numbers, and the adapter maps them back to the material's own `Source`. With no material the
model is not called.

The model's reply is untrusted. The adapter extracts JSON from prose, code fences or a reply cut
off at the token limit. A reply split into several top-level objects, such as `{"deck": …}`
followed by `{"notes": […]}`, is merged: the first deck wins and the notes are concatenated in
order. It then validates every note through the domain: a note of an
unrequested or unknown type, with fields that do not exactly match its type, an unrepairable
cloze, invalid distractors or no citable source is dropped, and NUL characters and lone
surrogates are stripped from every string first. Cloze numbering with gaps is renumbered from 1.
A note that asks the same thing as an earlier valid note of the same type is dropped as a
duplicate, keeping the first, before the cap, so a repeated reply does not use up `cardCount`
twice. What a note asks is its front and back for the basic types, its text for cloze, and its
question, answer and set of distractors, in any order, for multiple choice. `addReverse` and a
cloze's `extra` do not make two notes different, and a `basic_reversed` note with its sides
swapped is not a duplicate. At most `cardCount` notes are returned, never padded. A reply that
yields no note ends the job `NO_VALID_CONTENT`; a reply is never retried for its content.
`image_occlusion` is not generated here, because a valid note needs a licensed image the media
stage has to supply, and a request for it without `includeImages` is rejected up front.

Duplicates, and a distractor that repeats the answer or another distractor, are found with one
comparison (`domain/text.py`, `normalise_for_comparison`). It ignores case, fullwidth and
halfwidth forms, how an accent is encoded (`é` or `e` plus a combining accent), runs of
whitespace and invisible characters. It does not fold other compatibility forms: `x²`, `x₂` and
`x2`, `Straße` and `Strasse`, or a ligature and its letters stay different. Case is folded one
character at a time (Unicode simple case folding), which is why `ß` is not turned into `ss`.
The price of ignoring case is that `Polish` and `polish` count as the same.

Every call goes through `infrastructure/resilience.py`: a timeout per attempt
(`MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`), retries with exponential backoff and full jitter for transient
failures only (network errors, timeouts, 408/409/429/5xx, honouring `retry-after`), an overall
`MODEL_DEADLINE_SECONDS` after which no new attempt starts, and a circuit breaker per worker
process that opens after `MODEL_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` consecutive transient failures,
leaving out timeouts of oversized requests (see below). An outage or an open circuit ends the
job `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`; a rejected request (bad key, unknown model) ends it
`GENERATION_FAILED`. Keep the deadline below
`DECKLY_LIMIT_GENERATION_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` minus the time the earlier stages need, or Arq
kills the job first and it ends `GENERATION_FAILED` instead, and keep
`MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` small enough to be produced within one attempt's timeout, so a
large deck is cut at the token limit and its complete notes are kept rather than lost to a
timeout.

A slow oversized request is not a sign the provider is down, so the breaker does not treat its
timeouts like a small request's. The expected output of a request is estimated from its
`cardCount`, at 100 tokens per note plus 100 for the deck (`card_generator/prompt.py`). A request
expected to need at least half of `MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` is oversized
(`llm/resilient.py`), and its timeouts neither count toward the threshold nor reset the count;
a recovery trial that times out that way lets the next call try again. Its other transient
failures (network errors, 408/409/429/5xx) still count, since its size does not explain them.
The reasoning: generation time grows with the tokens produced, and the budget is meant to fit
one attempt. A request needing less than half of it that still times out means the provider is
running at under half its expected speed, which is an outage signal. Above half, ordinary
latency swings can push a healthy provider past the timeout, and one slow 200-card deck must
not open the circuit and fail every other job. With 16 000 tokens, decks of about 80 cards or
more are oversized; the app's wizard asks for at most 50. The estimate only classifies: every
request still asks for the whole `MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`. A timeout while connecting cannot be
told apart from a slow reply, so for an oversized request it is not counted either.

## Checks

```bash
make check          # ruff format --check, ruff check, mypy --strict, import-linter
make fix            # ruff format + ruff check --fix
make test           # pytest, no infrastructure needed
make test-integration  # Postgres + Redis tests; needs make up && make migrate
make test-live     # calls the model provider configured in .env; needs a real key, costs money
```

CI runs `make install`, `make check`, `make test`, then `make migrate` and `make test-integration`
against Postgres and Redis service containers (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `backend` job).
